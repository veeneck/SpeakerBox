/**
    This class represents a podium for each speaker. Podiums sit on top of the bottom letterbox. If there is one speaker, there would be one podium with a cropnode spanning the entire width. Two speakers would have two podiums, each being half the scene width. Each podium has a few elements:
 
    - The chat bubble representing who is speaking.
    - The podiumCrop which is a black bar (mask) representing the width of the podium.
    - The slidingWindow which is the pedestal the chatBubble sits in. By being in a crop, we can move it back and forth with the chatBubble.

    Constructs the podium base. This is the most complicated part, so let's run through an example using 2 speakers. The crop node for each speaker would be half of the screen width. Meanwhile, the slidingWindow is the width of the entire screen. But because the window sits in a crop node, the only portion visible will be half of the screen. With that in mind, you can imagine sliding the window back and forth which would move the podium (indentation) that the chatBubble sits on.
